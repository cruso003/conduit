2. **Write clear commit messages**
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Ensure tests pass**: `./scripts/test.sh`
6. **Run benchmarks** if performance-related: `./scripts/benchmark.sh`

**PR Template:**

```
**What does this PR do?**
Brief description of changes.

**Why is this needed?**
Explain the motivation.

**How was it tested?**
Describe your testing approach.

**Checklist:**

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/turboX.git
cd conduit

# Install Codon (if not already installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://exaloop.io/install.sh)"

# Build Conduit
./scripts/build.sh

# Run tests
./scripts/test.sh
```

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines where applicable
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Write docstrings for public APIs

**Example:**

```python
def parse_http_request(data: bytes) -> HTTPRequest:
    """
    Parse raw HTTP request data into HTTPRequest object.

    Args:
        data: Raw bytes from socket

    Returns:
        HTTPRequest object with parsed data

    Raises:
        ValueError: If request is malformed
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Add integration tests for features

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Run specific test
codon test tests/test_socket.codon
```

## Benchmarking

If your changes affect performance:

```bash
# Run benchmarks
./scripts/benchmark.sh

# Compare with baseline
python benchmarks/compare.py before.json after.json
```

## Documentation

- Update relevant docs in `docs/`
- Add examples if introducing new features
- Keep API reference up to date
- Write clear, concise explanations

## Questions?

- Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/cruso003/conduit/discussions)
- Ask in issues (use the "question" label)

## Recognition

Contributors will be listed in:

- README.md (Contributors section)
